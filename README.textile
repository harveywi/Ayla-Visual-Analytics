h1. Ayla Visual Analytics

http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~harveywi/ayla

h3. Introduction

Ayla is a free, open source visualization tool for researchers in biochemistry, molecular dynamics, and protein folding. It is cross-platform, running on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux systems.

Ayla features a rich visual analytics environment in which many researchers can work together. A storyboard metaphor is used to organize interesting events in the data. 

h4. Binary Files

The "Ayla website":http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~harveywi/ayla hosts the latest binaries (currently version 0.1) as well as a screencast demonstrating the functionality of the software.

h4. Source Code

See the "Ayla Github
repository":https://github.com/harveywi/Ayla-Visual-Analytics for source code and additional documentation.

h4. Prerequisites

The software is written in "Scala":http://www.scala-lang.org and "Oracle Java Version 6+":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html must be installed to run the binaries.  Processing large datasets (on the order of hundreds of thousands of protein conformations) can be memory-intensive; hence we recommend running the software on a machine with 8 GB of RAM or more.  (As the software matures, it will become faster and leaner.)
